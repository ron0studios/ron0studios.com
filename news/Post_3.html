          <article>
            Over the <strong>past few months</strong> development on opengl has been
            going strong and as of recently I have began to make a game engine, 
            <strong>The Ron0Engine</strong>. 
            <br>
            It has been, as of now, a month or so and I have progressed with directional shadow mapping,
            decent lighting and model loading. The alpha stage of the engine will most likely be publicly avaliable
            in some time around <strong>2020</strong> and will feature normal mapping and other
            effective graphics strategies. If you want to see what feature of the engine I am working on as
            of now then be sure to check my <strong><a href = "https://trello.com/b/h05itScX/ron0engine" target = "_blank">Trello Board</a></strong> and leave 
            any suggestions on what I should feature. I <strong>do not</strong> have a github for this, but when the alpha is released, there will most
            certainly be one. Finally, be aware that this is going to be freeware under strict copyright policies.
                                                                            <br>
                                                                            <br>
