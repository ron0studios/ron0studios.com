            Some time back, me and a colleague, who goes by the name BrillyWilly
             have invested some time into making this "movie-like" trailer to 
             hype up for some sort of collaboration that we haven't decided on 
             yet. Being the first post on this website, I would like to inform 
             that we will be further developing on this when the time is right. 
             Summer seems like an excellent option! <br>
             Being the first video posted on my second channel,  
             <strong><a href = "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGRCAJNhxAB7maEn_PLWj5g" target = "_blank">Ron0Studios</a></strong>, 
             it felt like it needed a fitting amount of editing and effort put into it. In regards to the trailer
             itself, i decided to go with the irony of making it a horror-like trailer. All of the editing and
             production of the video was made entirely in <i>Cyberlink Powerdirector</i>, which is a video editing tool
             avaliable on all android and windows devices. I personally used this only because it was easier to 
             understand and it has all the basic tools, for <strong>free!</strong> <br>
             I started by extracting many of the small edited clips from BrillyWilly's, MTB Mashup video, and filtered down 
             to the most <i> "epic" </i> moments. I also took out sections from my old Ron0Gaming videos and
             recorded myself placing a launchpad. Yes i have a launchpad and I <strong> do </strong> use it. 
             As for recording videos about my music, i am not sure yet. All the audio, <i>excluding the heartbeat sound
             at the end</i>, was found in a video that i cannot find as of now since it was probably deleted or
             possibly because i was using the incorrect search terms. I remember myself wondering about the painstaking
             amount of editing required to complete this, especially on a mobile app. The video was finished and
             uploaded. The thumbnail, again, was made on my phone using a mobile app and now that the hype was increasing
             i had to discuss with BrillyWilly about what we were actually going to do for the collab.<br><br>
             I thought at first we could design a game together, but that was a rubbish idea in general since I was only so 
             new to programming and BrillyWilly had no idea how to make the game music that suited my needs. Things
             were getting frustrating and the <strong>IDEA</strong> of a collab was fading slowly away. Then all of a 
             sudden i realised what had to be done. A music collab. We were both decent at making music and we both
             produced for the same genre so it must be the way we will collab if we ever do come across it.
             As of now, The release date for the collab will be around August and will be fully-featured, meaning that it 
             will use Adobe After Effects for cool visuals and the song will be mixed and ready. If you ever do have any
             suggestions on a future video, you can always comment and I <strong>will</strong> consider it.
