          <h1>COLLAB COMING SOON?</h1>
          <p>
            Some time back, me and a colleague, who goes by the name BrillyWilly have invested 
            some time into making this "movie-like" trailer to hype up for some sort of 
            collaboration that we haven't decided on yet. Being the first post on this 
            website, I would like to inform that we will be further developing on this 
            when the time is right. Summer seems like an excellent option!
